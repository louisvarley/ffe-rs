# Getting around: systems, maps and the autopilot (progress)

Started 2026-10-24 at the owner's request: a system map, a way to move between the
systems, and an autopilot to planets, stations and other bodies for testing.

## Status

| Piece | State |
|---|---|
| `ffe_rs::navigation::galaxy` | done: the 12 hand-coded systems (Sol, Alpha Centauri, Sirius, ...) with their names, plus four generated test systems |
| `navigation::bodies` | done: a system's stars, planets, moons, stations and starports with the original's names, placed by F880 at a game clock (positions in millimetres) |
| `navigation::autopilot` | done and tested (`tests/navigation.rs`, local cache): steers the original flight model with its own keys (pulsed), holds a braking-curve set speed, hands back a transfer for long legs |
| Map and jump UI in the playable | in progress (keys below) |
| Galaxy beyond the 12 hand-coded systems | not done: the other table systems need the sector star generator (F832-F856, tables `DATA_006799..6808`) and their name strings |

## The autopilot

`autopilot(flight, target, stop, memory) -> Command` each frame. It turns the nose with
the pitch and yaw keys (the keys build a turn rate and their amounts grow the longer they
are held, so they are pulsed and released), then raises or lowers the set speed with
Return/Shift to follow a braking envelope `sqrt(2 * 0.4 * 90 * distance)` (the reverse
thrust slows the ship by about 90 m/s per second; forward thrust gives about 300).

Legs longer than 1.5 million km (`APPROACH` 1.5e9 mm beyond the standoff) cannot be flown
in real time with the nose staying true (time acceleration multiplies every turn-rate
error: at 1000x a hair of drift swings the ship round). Once the nose is on the target the
command carries `skip = Some((landing, world_seconds))`: a transfer the caller carries out
by placing the ship at the approach point at rest and advancing the game clock by
`transfer_seconds` (full thrust up to the speed the braking can stop, then the braking).
The last 1.5 million km are flown for real. Tests: Sol's Pluto (39 AU: a 412,844 s
transfer then about 300 s of flight), Mercury and Daedalus.

## Keys (the playable)

(see the help overlay; wired in `main.rs`)

## Known limits

- The orientation the physics integrates drifts off orthonormal (rows 0.985 long after a
  while); the autopilot orthonormalises before steering.
- Planets are not drawn in the flight view yet (the surface renderer is partly ported:
  `docs/notes/terrain.md`), so the map and the autopilot's messages are the way to see
  where bodies are.
